      <h1>Quantum Computing</h1>
      <h2 id="what-is-quantum-computing">What is quantum computing?</h2>
      <p>
        Quantum computing is a rapidly-emerging technology that harnesses the
        laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical
        computers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, IBM Quantum makes real quantum hardware – a tool scientists only
        began to imagine three decades ago – available to hundreds of thousands
        of developers. Our engineers deliver ever-more-powerful superconducting
        quantum processors at regular intervals, alongside crucial advances in
        software and quantum-classical orchestration. This work drives toward
        the quantum computing speed and capacity necessary to change the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        These machines are very different from the classical computers that have
        been around for more than half a century. Here’s a primer on this
        transformative technology.
      </p>
      <h2 id="why-do-we-need-quantum-computers">
        Why do we need quantum computers?
      </h2>
      <p>For some problems, supercomputers aren’t that super.</p>
      <p>
        When scientists and engineers encounter difficult problems, they turn to
        supercomputers. These are very large classical computers, often with
        thousands of classical CPU and GPU cores. However, even supercomputers
        struggle to solve certain kinds of problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a supercomputer gets stumped, that’s probably because the big
        classical machine was asked to solve a problem with a high degree of
        complexity. When classical computers fail, it’s often due to complexity
      </p>
      <p>
        Complex problems are problems with lots of variables interacting in
        complicated ways. Modeling the behavior of individual atoms in a
        molecule is a complex problem, because of all the different electrons
        interacting with one another. Sorting out the ideal routes for a few
        hundred tankers in a global shipping network is complex too.
      </p>
      <h2 id="how-do-quantum-computers-work">How do quantum computers work?</h2>
      <p>
        Quantum computers are elegant machines, smaller and requiring less
        energy than supercomputers. An IBM Quantum processor is a wafer not much
        bigger than the one found in a laptop. And a quantum hardware system is
        about the size of a car, made up mostly of cooling systems to keep the
        superconducting processor at its ultra-cold operational temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
        A classical processor uses bits to perform its operations. A quantum
        computer uses qubits (CUE-bits) to run multidimensional quantum
        algorithms.
      </p>
      <h2 id="superfluid’s">Superfluid’s</h2>
      <p>
        Your desktop computer likely uses a fan to get cold enough to work. Our
        quantum processors need to be very cold – about a hundredth of a degree
        above absolute zero. To achieve this, we use super-cooled superfluids to
        create superconductors.
      </p>
      <h2 id="superconductors">Superconductors</h2>
      <p>
        At those ultra-low temperatures certain materials in our processors
        exhibit another important quantum mechanical effect: electrons move
        through them without resistance. This makes them “superconductors.”
      </p>
      <p>
        When electrons pass through superconductors they match up, forming
        “Cooper pairs.” These pairs can carry a charge across barriers, or
        insulators, through a process known as quantum tunneling. Two
        superconductors placed on either side of an insulator form a Josephson
        junction.
      </p>
      <h2 id="control">Control</h2>
      <p>
        Our quantum computers use Josephson junctions as superconducting qubits.
        By firing microwave photons at these qubits, we can control their
        behavior and get them to hold, change, and read out individual units of
        quantum information.
      </p>
      <h2 id="superposition">Superposition</h2>
      <p>
        A qubit itself isn’t very useful. But it can perform an important trick:
        placing the quantum information it holds into a state of superposition,
        which represents a combination of all possible configurations of the
        qubit. Groups of qubits in superposition can create complex,
        multidimensional computational spaces. Complex problems can be
        represented in new ways in these spaces.
      </p>
      <h2 id="entanglement">Entanglement</h2>
      <p>
        Entanglement is a quantum mechanical effect that correlates the behavior
        of two separate things. When two qubits are entangled, changes to one
        qubit directly impact the other. Quantum algorithms leverage those
        relationships to find solutions to complex problems.
